this is an assignment regarding webscraping of an API Jason which i did for the "USING PYTHON TO ACCESS WEB DATA" course of michigan university offered through coursera.The program will prompt for a location, contact a web service and retrieve JSON for the web service and parse that data, and retrieve the first place_id from the JSON. A place ID is a textual identifier that uniquely identifies a place as within Google Maps.To call the API, you need to include a key= parameter and provide the address that you are requesting as the address= parameter that is properly URL encoded using the urllib.parse.urlencode() function.
